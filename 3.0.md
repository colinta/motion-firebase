###### Checklist:

[ ] Set a global URL
[ ] `connected_state` => `connected?`
[ ] `auth` no longer calls `cancel` block
[ ] `unauth` => `logout`
[ ] `auth_state` => `authenticated?`
[ ] `on_auth` => `authenticated?`
[ ] FirebaseSimpleLogin is GONE

###### Added the ability to set a global URL

`Firebase.url = 'your-app-name'`

This is required if you want to use the static methods like `Firebase.connected?`

###### `connected_state` => `connected?`

`connected_state` is still around, but it has been improved and renamed to
`connected?`, which accepts a block.  Instead of a snapshot, this block will
receive a boolean (`is_connected`).

###### Firebase.authenticate

This method used to call `authWithCredential(withCompletionBlock:withCancelBlock:)`,
but that method has been deprecated in favor of `authWithCustomToken(withCompletionBlock:)`.

The new method uses just one block.  You should update your code to accept
`error` and `auth_data` arguments, and use `Firebase.authenticated?` to monitor
authenticated state.

```ruby
Firebase.authenticate(token) { |error, auth_data| }
```

###### Firebase.unauth

Is now `Firebase.logout`

###### Firebase.auth_state

Is gone, in favor of `Firebase.authenticated?`.  You can no longer get a
Firebase ref that points to the auth state directly.

###### Firebase.on_auth

Is gone, in favor of `Firebase.authenticated?`

###### FirebaseSimpleLogin is GONE

No more `motion-firebase-auth` at all.  Porting is pretty easy, though.

Before, you had to get create a FirebaseSimpleLogin object

```ruby
auth = FirebaseSimpleLogin.new(firebase_ref)
auth.login(email: email, password: password)
auth.logout
```

Now you just use the `firebase_ref` directly, and it's encouraged to use the
static version of these methods.

```ruby
Firebase.login(email: email, password: password)
Firebase.logout
```

Many of the methods like `create`, etc are appended with `_user`, and again the
static version is encouraged.

```ruby
# FirebaseSimpleLogin methods:
auth.create(email:, password:)
auth.remove(email:, password:) { |error| }
auth.login(email:, password:) { |error, user| }
auth.update(email:, old_password:, new_password:) { |error, success| }
auth.send_password_reset(email:)

# are now:
Firebase.create_user_and_login(email:, password:) { |error, auth_data| }
Firebase.create_user(email:, password:) { |error| }  # user is not logged in!
Firebase.remove_user(email:, password:) { |error| }
Firebase.login(email:, password:) { |error, auth_data| }
Firebase.update_user(email:, old_password:, new_password:) { |error| }
Firebase.send_password_reset(email:) { |error| }

# this one is new:
Firebase.login_anonymously { |error, auth_data| }
```

Removed methods:

```ruby
auth.check { |error, user| }
Firebase.authenticated? { |is_authenticated| }  # does the same thing, pretty much
```

The Facebook and Twitter methods are different, you'll need to use
`open_facebook_session` and `open_twitter_session`.  The old methods
(`login_to_facebook`) did a lot more, but at the sacrifice that you lost some
control of your app.  The new methods are more hands off.
